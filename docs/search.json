    "text": "General Issues\n\nCheck your HTML for plot-text transition problems. One of the hardest things to get people to do is add empty lines in R Markdown after they create a plot or heading. Forgetting to do this can cause your plots to show up in the HTML with the start of the next paragraph shown to the right of the plot instead of below the plot. Make sure you avoid this mistake. Also, Hit ENTER after every pipe and + in your code so that you avoid scrollable windows for code in your HTML output.\nMissing Data Mechanism and Dealing with Missingness. You need to have an explicit statement about your assumed missing data mechanism, including either the term MCAR, MAR or MNAR, in both Study 1 and Study 2, and you have to be specific about what you’ve done. This should be part of your HTML file everywhere where you impute (as in Study 2 variables other than your outcome and key predictor) or filter to complete cases (as in Study 1 and with your Study 2 outcome and key predictor). None of your analyses (in Study 1 or Study 2) should involve missing values: either you should have imputed missing values or you should have filtered to complete cases.\nSpell check doesn’t check headings and subheadings. Using spell check in R Studio is trivial (just hit F7) and important, but be aware that you still need to read your HTML to be sure that you don’t have problems. A particular issue is that the spell check doesn’t check your headings and subheadings so you’ll want to pay especially close attention to those pieces. In particular, I’ve seen several people misspell the word “Transformations” in section 6 of Study 2.\nYour confidence level is 90%, not 95%. All of Project B uses a 90% confidence level, so the phrase “p &lt; 0.05” is 100% irrelevant to this work. If you must compare a p value to something, be sure it is 0.10. I would also strongly suggest you search through your work and eliminate the terms “statistical significance” and even “significant” unless you have a very good reason to include them.\nOrder multi-categorical factors properly. Please respect the ordering of multicategorical variables, especially in Analyses C and E for Study 1. Be sure that you adjust the levels of your factor so that they use the natural order of the variable. If you have a nominal multi-categorical variable, like race/ethnicity, in Study 2, then I suggest you order the levels of that factor variable from largest to smallest in terms of number of subjects, so that the baseline group will be the one that appears most frequently in your data.\nDon’t change numeric variables to factors. If you change a numeric variable to a factor, and then change it back into a numeric variable, that will create many, many problems. Don’t do that. Instead, create a new factor variable if you’re going to convert a numeric variable into categories."

Each of your four Study 1 Analyses should stand on its own, in the sense that you should specify the relevant group of subjects, the exposure and the outcome in words at the start of each of those analyses. Please label these as Analysis A, B, C, D or E, (leaving out one, of course) as I did in building the assignment.\nDescribe the direction and size of estimated effects. In Project B, you should have no statements about statistical significance or any synonym. Estimate effects whenever possible, including a confidence interval. This is easy for Study 2 and for Study 1 Analyses A, B, and D, I think, but more challenging for C and E. Be sure to carefully focus your description of your result on the direction and size of the effect you estimate, in the context of your problem.\n\n\nFor instance, a terrible sentence in Analysis B would be something like “We saw a significant difference between males and females on mean systolic blood pressure.”\nA better sentence would be something like “The mean systolic blood pressure for males was 3 mm Hg higher than that of females, with a 90% CI of (1, 5).” Notice that this better sentence includes the actual units of measurement, and not something generic like “points”.\n\n\nPaired vs. Independent Samples. In Analyses A and B for Study 1, be sure that you provide a logical argument near the top of your work for why the data you are studying use (in Analysis A, paired) (in Analysis B, independent) samples.\nSimplifying Conclusions in Analysis D. In Analysis D of Study 1, in writing up your conclusions after forming an appropriate 2x2 table, and specifying the probabilities of obtaining your outcome within each exposure group as estimated at the top of the table, it is completely sufficient to provide your interpretation of either:\n\n\nthe relative risk and the odds ratio and their confidence intervals, or\nthe relative risk and the difference in probabilities, with their confidence intervals.\n\n\nDescribe some percentages in Analysis E. In Analysis E for Study 1, you should focus your interpretation of the result from your table and chi-square test on a comparison of interesting percentages from your table, in addition to the p value and a visualization of the results."

In Study 2, in the Transformation of Outcome section, please show the Box-Cox analysis immediately after the starting graphical summary (as opposed to the strange approach I used in the template) and then either use it (which is fine) or specify why you’ve decided not to use it. Remember that a Box-Cox \\(\\lambda\\) near 0 suggests a logarithmic transformation, and that a Box-Cox \\(\\lambda\\) of 1 indicates no transformation.\nUsing Validated R-Square. In Study 2, you should use the validated R-square you develop in section 10.3.2 as part of your discussion in both Sections 10.4 and 11.1. (in addition to whatever else you decide to use) to help describe how successful your winning model is.

    "text": "Headings you should use in the Study 2 report\nAll of your work should be done in a fresh R project in a clean directory on your computer.\n\nSetup and Data Ingest\nCleaning the Data\n\nBe sure to review the material (including the Tips on Cleaning Data) provided in the Data Development section of this website, in particular regarding how to deal with missing data in Study 2.\nIf you have any missing data which you impute as part of Study 2, provide a description of that process as a subsection here, and demonstrate that imputation was needed, specify the missing data mechanism you are assuming (MAR or MCAR are the available choices) and then demonstrate that after imputation you have a complete data set.\n\nCodebook and Data Description\n\nFollow the headings and steps laid out in the Study 1 instructions for this section.\nYou should include subsections for your codebook, a listing of your analytic tibble, and a numeric description, as you did in Study 1.\nMake the word Outcome in bold the first word of the description for your outcome in your codebook.\nMake the words Key Predictor in bold the first two words of the description for your key predictor in your codebook.\n\nMy Research Question\n\nSpecify your research question, with whatever introduction and background you feel is required for Dr. Love to understand its importance. If you have a pre-analytic guess as to how this will work out in your setting, please feel encouraged to include that here. The actual question should end with a question mark, and be appropriate for the nature of the analyses to come.\n\nPartitioning the Data\n\nSplit the data into two samples (a model training sample containing 60-80% of the data, and a model test sample containing the remaining 20-40%.) Details on how to do this are available here.\nBe sure to demonstrate that each subject in the original data wound up in either your training or your test sample.\n\nTransforming the Outcome\n\nUsing your training sample, provide appropriate, well-labeled visualizations of your outcome, and investigate potential transformations of that outcome for the purpose of fitting regression models in a useful way.\nMake a clear decision about what transformation (if any) you want to use. Don’t use a transformation you cannot interpret.\nIf your outcome is symmetric but with outliers, power transformations will not be of much help.\nIf your outcome includes non-positive values, you may have to add the same value to each observation of the outcome before using power transformations. (For instance, if some of your values of your raw outcome are 0, you might add 1 to each observation before considering a transformation.)\n\nThe Big Model\n\nFit a linear regression model including all of your candidate predictors for your (possibly transformed) outcome within your training sample. Summarize its prediction equation, and the other materials available through a tidy summary of the coefficients.\nIf you want to divide this work into subsections, that’s up to you.\n\nThe Smaller Model\n\nFit a linear regression model using a subset of your predictors that is interesting, again using the training sample. Summarize its prediction equation, and the other materials available through a tidy summary of the coefficients.\nYour subset must include at least two predictors, including the key predictor, and a perfectly reasonable strategy for this project is simply to compare a “naive” model with the key predictor and one other predictor to the full model with all of the predictors you have identified.\nIf you prefer to use another subset of predictors from your big model as your smaller model, that’s fine, too. If you’d prefer to use an automated or semi-automated strategy for identifying your subset of predictors from the big model, that’s also fine, but you must have at least two predictors in your smaller model.\nIf you want to divide this work into subsections, that would be helpful.\n\nIn-Sample Comparison\n\nPresent four subsections here, as labeled below.\nIn Quality of Fit, summarize the quality of fit (focusing on \\(R^2\\), adjusted \\(R^2\\), AIC and BIC) within the training sample.\nIn Posterior Predictive Checks, comment on systematic discrepancies you observe for each model between the real and simulated data.\nIn Assessing Assumptions, create and assess residual plots (specifically you should be looking at the assumptions of linearity, constant variance and Normality) for each of the two models. Also discuss whether there are any highly influential points, and if so, identify them.\nIn Comparing the Models, comment on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two models within your training sample. A graph of some key summaries would be appropriate, accompanied by comments on assumptions and posterior predictive checks. Which model do you prefer, based on this information?\n\nModel Validation\n\nThis should have four subsections, as labeled below.\nCalculating Prediction Errors Apply each of your models to the test sample to predict the outcome and do whatever back-transformation of predictions is necessary.\nVisualizing the Predictions Provide an appropriate visualization of the outcome predictions (after back-transformation) as compared to the actual outcome values, made by the two models in your test sample. Are they similar?\n\nSuch plots help you see the range of predicted values for each model on the X axis, and compare it to the range of observed values on the Y axis. Many models will be overly conservative, only predicting outcomes within a small range. For instance, if your big model’s range of predictions is much more in keeping with the observed range, that’s a reason to like the big model.\nSuch plots also help you see if one of the models matches the line for observed = predicted better than the other within your test sample.\n\nSummarizing the Errors Then summarize the following values, all on the scale of the original untransformed outcome, across the observations in your test sample, in an attractive table.\n\nsquare root of the mean squared prediction error (RMSPE)\nmean absolute prediction error (MAPE)\nmaximum absolute prediction error (MAE)\nsquared correlation of the actual and predicted values (validated \\(R^2\\))\n\nComparing the Models Use the results from the previous two subsections to comment on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two models within your test sample. Which model do you prefer now?\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis should have four subsections, as labeled below.\nChosen Model\n\nSpecify which model you’ve chosen, based on your conclusions from sections 9 and 10.\n\nAnswering My Question\n\nUse the result of this model to answer your research question in a few sentences. Comment on whether your results matched up with your pre-analysis expectations, and also specify any limitations you see on this conclusion.\n\nNext Steps\n\nDiscuss an interesting next step you would like to pursue to learn more about this sort of research question or to go further with these data.\n\nReflection\n\nBriefly describe what you would have done differently in Study 2 had you known at the start of the project what you have learned by doing it.\n\n\nInclude the session information with session_info() from the xfun package as a separate section at the end of your report."

Use a 90% confidence level for all Study 1 work, please.\n\nAgain, if you are using NHANES data, you will need between 500 and 8,750 observations with a minimum of 500 observations containing complete data on all of the variables you will use in Study 1.\nIf you are using any other data source, you will need between 250 and 10,000 observations, and at least 250 with complete data on all variables you will use in Study 1.\nIn Study 1, you should explicitly state that you are assuming that the “missing completely at random (MCAR)” mechanism for missing data, and then filter until you have only complete cases.\n\nEach analysis should be self-contained (so that I don’t have to read Analysis A first to understand Analysis C, for example). Present each new analysis as a subsection with an appropriate heading in the table of contents.\n\nAnalysis A. Compare two means/medians using paired samples\nHere, you will need to identify two quantitative variables (outcomes) which are paired (so that they have a natural link between them, and use the same units of measurement.) You’ll analyze the results and build a confidence interval for the population mean difference with an appropriate t-based or bootstrap procedure. Again, we require that all variables treated as quantitative in Study 1 (Analyses A, B, or C) contain at least 15 unique values.\n\n\nAnalysis B. Compare two means/medians using independent samples\nHere, you will need to identify one quantitative (outcome) and one categorical variable (binary - 2 levels.) You’ll analyze the results and build a confidence interval for the difference in means with an appropriate t-based or bootstrap procedure. Note that it’s generally easier to find independent samples comparisons than paired samples comparisons in most of the data I expect you’ll be using. This would require a quantitative outcome (with at least 15 unique values), and a binary categorical variable which divides the data into two subgroups, so that each subgroup has a minimum of 30 observations.\n\n\nAnalysis C. Compare 3-6 means/medians using independent samples\nHere, you will need to identify one quantitative (outcome) and one categorical variable (multi-categorical with 3-6 levels.) Here, you should be thinking about an analysis of variance with either a set of Holm (probably better if you have unequal sample sizes in your groups) or Tukey HSD (better if you have a fairly balanced design) pairwise comparisons. This would require a quantitative outcome (with at least 15 unique values), and a multi-categorical variable with 3-6 categories which divides the data into subgroups, so that each subgroup has a minimum of 30 observations.\n\n\nAnalysis D. Create and analyze a \\(2 \\times 2\\) table\nHere, you will need to identify two categorical (binary) variables. Each cell of the resulting 2 x 2 table should contain a minimum of 30 subjects. You should be focused on the relative risk, odds ratio (sample version) and risk difference comparisons for point estimates, and on interpreting the confidence interval for the risk difference comparison.\n\n\nAnalysis E. Create and analyze a \\(J \\times K\\) table, where \\(2 \\leq J \\leq 5\\) and \\(3 \\leq K \\leq 5\\)\nHere, you will need to identify two categorical variables, at least one of which should contain 3-5 levels, while the other contains 2-5 levels. Each cell in the cross-tabulation of the two variables within the table should have a minimum of 15 observations. Here, you should be providing an appropriate cross-tabulation, the results of a chi-square test, accompanied by a useful visualization and description of the nature of the observed association."

We can see from our numerical summary earlier that the minimum sbp2 in our hbp_train sample is 90, so we’re OK.\n\nNote that I am restricting myself here to the five predictors I actually intend to use in building models.\nAlthough we’re generally using a 90% confidence interval in this project, we won’t worry about that issue in the boxCox plot, and instead just look at the point estimate from powerTransform.\nThese commands (boxCox and powerTransform) come from the car package.\n\n\nmodel_temp &lt;- lm(sbp2 ~ sbp1 + age + bmi1 + diabetes + tobacco,\n                 data = hbp_train)\n\nboxCox(model_temp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated power transformation is about 0.5, which looks like a square root transformation of sbp2 is useful. Given that I’m using another measure of sbp, specifically, sbp1 to predict sbp2, perhaps I want to transform that, too?\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(hbp_train, aes(x = sbp1, y = sqrt(sbp2))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", col = \"red\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"SQRT(sbp2) vs. SBP1\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(hbp_train, aes(x = sqrt(sbp1), y = sqrt(sbp2))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", col = \"red\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"SQRT(sbp2) vs. SQRT(sbp1)\")\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t see an especially large difference between these two plots. It is up to you to decide whether a transformation suggested by boxCox should be applied to your data.\n\nFor the purposes of this project, you should stick to transformations of strictly positive outcomes, and to the square root (power = 0.5), square (power = 2), logarithm (power = 0) and inverse (power = -1) transformations. Don’t make the transformation without being able to interpret the result well.\nFeel encouraged to scale your transformations (by multiplying or dividing by a constant) so that most of the transformed values wind up between 0 and 100 or 0 and 1000, if you like.\nIf you do decide to include a transformation of your outcome in fitting models, be sure to back-transform any predictions you make at the end of the study so that we can understand the prediction error results.\nIf your outcome data are substantially multimodal, I wouldn’t treat the boxCox results as meaningful.\n\nI’m going to use the square root transformation for both my outcome and for the key predictor, but I don’t think it makes a big difference. I’m doing it mostly so that I can show you how to back-transform later."

Your use of the data for this project must not be subject to IRB approval, or the approval of anyone other than you (so, for example, if you would also need the approval of a principal investigator to use the data, that won’t work for Project B.)\n\nThere can be no protected health information or protected information or privacy risk of any kind involved with the data.\n\nDr. Love will need to see your source for the data in its entirety. You will need to be able to provide a link to a web page from which you (and Dr. Love and anyone else) can download the raw data as part of your registration for the project in mid-November.\nThe data must be cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal.\n\nThe only exception to this rule would be data where a baseline set of predictors is measured, which might include the baseline measure of the outcome, and then the outcome (and only the outcome) is measured at a later time.\n\nThe data must not be hierarchical, so everything must be measured at the subject level.\n\nWe cannot have subjects nested in states, for instance, with some variables measured only at the state level included in your set of variables.\nThe data you select must in all ways be suitable for the analyses required in Project B.\n\nThe data must not be from County Health Rankings, nor can they appear in any teaching repository of data (including the ones at Cleveland Clinic), nor can they be data from our 431 materials, including Lab assignments, Course Notes or Class Slides.\nThe data must not be pre-compiled as part of an R package, but rather available in raw form and ingested into R by you.\nDr. Love has a strong preference for data that describe individual people or animals, as opposed to other types of “subjects”. Who the subjects (rows) of your data are must be completely clear. No genomics data, either, in Project B - Dr. Love is insufficiently familiar with that sort of data.\nDr. Love can refuse to let you use a data set for any reason at all, and this includes the reason that he’s tired of the data set.\n\nPlease visit the Data Requirements for Study 1 and Study 2 on the Data Development page to ensure that your data will meet all necessary requirements."

This would require a quantitative outcome (with at least 15 unique values), and a multi-categorical variable with 3-6 categories which divides the data into subgroups, so that each subgroup has a minimum of 30 observations.\nFor Analysis D, you will need appropriate data to allow you to create and analyze a 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 table. This would require two independently collected binary categorical variables, that split the data into four groups in a 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 table, each with a minimum of 30 observations.\nFor Analysis E, you will need appropriate data to allow you to create and analyze a J \\(\\times\\) K table, where \\(2 \\leq J \\leq 5\\) and \\(3 \\leq K \\leq 5\\). This would require two independently collected categorical variables (one with J groups and one with K groups), that split the data into groups in a J \\(\\times\\) K table, so that each cell within the table has a minimum of 15 observations.\nAt a bare minimum, then, you will need a quantitative outcome (for Analyses A, B and C) and two binary variables (one for B and two for D and one for E) and a multi-categorical variable with 3-5 levels (for C and E) although you are welcome to use different variables from the same data source for each of the four Study 1 analyses you complete.\n\nNumber and type of variables for Study 2\n\nYou will need a quantitative outcome. Again, we require that your quantitative outcome contains at least 15 unique values.\nYou will need a key predictor of interest (which may be either quantitative, or categorical.) If it is categorical, it must have 2-6 categories, and each category must contain at least 30 observations. Your research question will focus largely on how effectively this key predictor can be used to predict your quantitative outcome.\nYou will need to identify 3-8 additional predictors of your outcome, at least one of which must be a multi-categorical predictor with 3-6 categories, where each category contains at least 30 observations. The other predictors can be any combination of quantitative and categorical (with 2-6 categories each, with at least 30 observations in each category.)\n\nYour data for each Study must be managed, merged (if necessary) and cleaned exclusively using R to go from raw data to that Study’s final clean tibble. This data management process must include the creation of appropriately labeled (and, if necessary, collapsed) factors for all categorical variables you will use in either study, and appropriate investigation and actions regarding missing values, numbers of unique values, and impossible values.\nYou will need to generate a single clean data set which you will then use for all four of your Study 1 analyses. For Study 1, work with a data set that has complete cases only on all of the analytic variables you study in your various Study 1 analyses. Describe those data overall using a codebook and an appropriate set of numerical summaries for your variables.\nYou will need to generate a single clean data set for all of your Study 2 analyses, which you will then partition (after single imputation of all variables besides your outcome and key predictor, to deal with missing values of all of your non-key predictors, if they exist) into a model training (or development) sample containing 60-80% of the data, and a model testing (or validation) sample containing the remaining 20-40% of the data. Describe the training data overall using a codebook and an appropriate set of numerical summaries, as you did in Study 1.\n\n\n\nTips on Cleaning Your Data\n\nIf you need to merge data (for instance in NHANES) clean the data after completing the merge.\nNote that it’s only necessary to clean the variables you will actually use in your analyses below. Create an analytic data set containing only those variables.\n\nThis should include a subject identification code (the SEQN in NHANES), your outcome, your key predictor and your other predictors.\nIf you are working with NHANES 2017-March 2020 data, you must include RIDSTATR and RIDAGEYR from the P_DEMO file.\n\nInclude RIDSTATR just so that you can prove that all of its values are 2 in your sample.\nInclude RIDAGEYR even if you’re not using it in your models, so you can describe the ages of the people in your sample.\n\n\nIf you create a categorical variable from a quantitative one, do so in this section of your report, and then refer to that work in the analyses below when you use the new variable. In general, though, I wouldn’t do that except in dire circumstances. Variables that use categories to describe what were originally quantitative variables aren’t quantitative any more.\nThings I would treat as missing include responses like Refused, Don’t Know, Did Not Respond, Unknown, No response and missing.\n\nIf you have a quantitative variable that includes a code like 5555 or 9999 for “don’t know” or “missing”, you will need to identify those cases as missing when ingesting the data, just as you would if you were working with a categorical variable.\nBe sure that R recognizes things that are missing as missing.\n\nCollapse levels sensibly for multi-categorical variables with more than 6 categories. If you want to use more than 6 categories for a categorical variable in your analyses, contact Dr. Love.\n\nIf you have a categorical variable with codes like 77, 88 or 99, in addition to treating those as missing, you want to drop those levels from the factors you create. I recommend you run droplevels() on your tibble to remove all factor levels with zero subjects. That can help down the line.\n\nFor NHANES folks, a few specific things:\n\nGender vs. Sex I would treat the RIAGENDR variable as describing biological sex and would rename it as I created a factor.\nRace/Ethnicity If you want to use race/ethnicity I would prefer the use of RIDRETH3 over RIDRETH1, and I would recommend using all six categories, assuming you have at least 100 subjects at each level after whatever other pruning you do. If you want to collapse, then lumping codes 1 and 2 into “Hispanic/Latinx” is acceptable. Remember that race/ethnicity as a covariate is an attempt to understand the impact of structural racism, at least as much as it is anything else, so interpretation requires special care.\nAge Do not use a categorical version of age. Use the quantitative version, called RIDAGEYR, provided in the P_DEMO data. When you describe your subjects, you should specify the range (minimum and maximum) ages of those subjects, so you will need to capture RIDAGEYR in your final analytic data set even if you’re not including it in your regression models.\nIncome and Measurement Caps The family income ratio INDFMPIR is appealing and quantitative, but it has a pronounced ceiling effect. It is the ratio of income to the poverty level, but is capped at 5. How should you think about that? (Note that age in adults is also capped, at 80.)\nEducation Categories If you’re working with adults (ages 20 and over), the DMDEDUC2 variable in the P_DEMO file is the set of categories to use. I would probably collapse codes 1 and 2 together to create a four-category variable with “Less than HS”, “HS Grad”, “Some College”, “College Grad”.\n\nBe sure to treat all multi-categorical variables as factors in R, and don’t treat numeric codes as meaningful numeric variables.\nMake sure that all of your quantitative variables have sensible minimum and maximum values as you’re cleaning.\nSome binary variables are coded 1 and 2. Fix that in your work, ideally by using the real names and treating the variable as a factor, or by converting the 1-2 to a proper 1-0 indicator variable.\n\nUse the formula NEWVAR = 2 - OLDVAR to turn OLDVAR: 1 = Yes, 2 = No into NEWVAR: 1 = Yes, 0 = No.\nIf you have OLDVAR: 1 = No, 2 = Yes, create a NEWVAR with 1 = Yes, 0 = No using NEWVAR = OLDVAR - 1.\n\nIn Study 1, filter to complete cases. In Study 2, You should only filter to complete cases on the outcome and key predictor in Study 2. Then, perform single (simple) imputation using the mice package for any variables that are neither your outcome or your key predictor in Study 2 with missing values.\nYou are welcome to apply janitor::clean_names at the start or end of your cleaning, if you like. If you do decide to change the names as well (and that’s a good idea if a name is long or confusing, especially with NHANES), that’s great, but be sure to specify the original names as well in the codebook.\nPlease don’t include sanity checks in your report. We’ll trust you have to have done that work on your own.\nAgain, if you have missing data, you will do different things in Study 1 and Study 2 about this.\n\n\nIn Study 1, you should explicitly state that you are assuming that the “missing completely at random (MCAR)” mechanism for missing data, and then filter until you have only complete cases.\nIn Study 2, you should explicitly state that you are assuming that “missing at random (MAR)” is the most appropriate missing data mechanism and then use single imputation for Study 2, with two exceptions: (1) I don’t want you to impute your outcome or key predictor, so you will need to filter to complete cases on those variables, and (2) you may decide to add on a multiple imputation summary of parameters for the final model if you choose, as we’ll discuss in Class 21.\n\n\n\nTo use data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).\n\nPlease read the Data Requirements for Study 1 and Study 2 and Tips on Cleaning Your Data above, then read the additional details on what is required if you’re working with NHANES data here.\nMany people (in past years) have felt that using NHANES data was a little easier than using another data source. To encourage people to use data other than NHANES, there is a four-point bonus in the final project B grade available for all projects which use non-NHANES data.\n\n\n\nTo use data from a non-NHANES source that meets with Dr. Love’s approval.\n\nPlease read the Data Requirements for Study 1 and Study 2 and Tips on Cleaning Your Data above, then read the additional details on what is required if you’re instead working with some other data source here.\nAgain, to encourage people to use data other than NHANES, there is a four-point bonus available to all projects which use non-NHANES data."

If you have an emergency on the day of your presentation, email Dr. Love as soon as possible. Zoom information will be provided to you by December 1.\nYour meeting will involve materials from each of your studies, discussed in a fairly regimented way, described below. If you are working with a partner, Dr. Love will randomly determine at the meeting who will speak and when, so you need to each be prepared to give the entire presentation. Dr. Love will keep track of time, and move you along as necessary, so you won’t have to worry about that.\n\nYou will need to share a screen to show me the key results as you describe them for each of the analyses in Study 1 and in Study 2 that you wind up discussing. It is best if one of you is prepared to share their screen for both presentations, if you’re working with a partner, and I encourage you to practice this in advance.\nYou are welcome to show me results in the context of a Powerpoint-style presentation, if you prefer to develop one, or to show me results straight from your Quarto-created HTML files in your portfolio. Whatever works for you - so long as I can see what you are talking about as you are talking, we’ll be fine. Make sure you know how to increase the size of the text in your HTML file while presenting it.\nI will NOT be able to pull up your report or other materials while we are talking. You will have to be able to do that.\n\n\nStudy 1 presentation (6-8 minutes)\nIn Study 1, you will first select your most interesting / intriguing result out of your four main analyses and present that, in about 2 minutes. In those 2 minutes, you should be showing me the highlights of that Analysis, specifically:\n\nWhich Analysis (A, B, C, D, or E) are we describing?\nWhat research question are you investigating, and what variables did you use?\nWhat conclusion did you draw about that question?\nWhat statistical method led you to that conclusion?\n\nI will then ask you to tell me which of the other analyses (meaning A, B, C, D, or E) you did. I will then ask you to present the results of one of the other analyses you did, in a similar way. You will need to come prepared to present this information for any of your Study 1 analyses at a moment’s notice, as you will not know in advance which of your other analyses you did that I will ask for.\n\n\nStudy 2 presentation (10-12 minutes)\nIn Study 2, you will start with telling me about the most important finding of your little study in 5 minutes. In these 5 minutes, you will tell me:\n\nWhat your research question was and why it was interesting to you (combined this should take no more than 30 seconds)\nWhat your better model has to say about the answer to your research question\n\nThis should include a description of the predictors that wound up in your (final) model and the direction of each of their effects on your outcome. Show me the model as you’re telling me about this.\nThis should also include a sense of how well the model predicted overall (\\(R^2\\) is one good choice.)\nThis should also include whether the posterior predictive plots show systematic discrepancies between the fitted model’s predictions and your observed data. Show me the plot as you’re telling me about this.\nThis should also include a discussion of whether residual plots for your final model fit regression assumptions. Show me the plots as you’re telling me about this.\nYour conclusions about rational next steps to learn more from these data, or what specific new data you now wish you’d had when you started the study.\n\n\nFor most of the remaining time, I will ask you about your study, and try to help you think through any problems you had in obtaining or interpreting analyses. You should come prepared to share any of the steps in your analysis at a moment’s notice, as we may want to look at any part of your work.\n\n\nFinal Questions (2-4 minutes)\nDepending on remaining time, I may ask you any of several questions at the end of our meeting. Some possibilities you should be prepared for include the following (some of which also appear in the self-evaluation)\n\nWhat percentage of your time in Project B did you spend obtaining, cleaning, merging and tidying data, as opposed to actually performing analyses on tidy data?\nTell me something useful that you learned from doing Project B.\nTell me what the hardest part of doing Project B was.\nWhat did you learn from Project A that was helpful in doing Project B?\nWhat do you know now that you wish you’d known back when you started Project B back in November? What would you tell yourself if you could go back in time?\n\n\n\n\nA Special Note\nIf you’ve read down to here before 5 PM on December 1, thanks and here’s an opportunity for a little bonus credit. Send Dr. Love an email no later than 5 PM on December 1 with the subject line 431 Favorite Song, telling him your favorite song (and providing a link to a video of the song on YouTube), and you’ll get some bonus credit.\n\n\nSelf-Evaluation for Project B\nThe Self-Evaluation for Project B Form will be available in December and should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are working in a team, each of you need to complete the form as an individual.\nThe Form is also due when the Project B Portfolio is due, and you’ll complete it after meeting with Dr. Love for your presentation.

The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation.\n\n\nThe NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.\n\n\nThe NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.\n\n\nFindings from this survey will be used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases. Information will be used to assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention. NHANES findings are also the basis for national standards for such measurements as height, weight, and blood pressure. Data from this survey will be used in epidemiological studies and health sciences research, which help develop sound public health policy, direct and design health programs and services, and expand the health knowledge for the Nation."

If you work as a pair, you will commit to that when you register for the project. Each of you will receive the team grade for the project reports, and an individual grade for the other components of the project.\n\n\nThe Data\nYou will work with the same data source for Study 1 and for Study 2, and these data will be developed either from NHANES or from another public source that you identify.\n\nYou will find detailed instructions regarding the use of NHANES data for Project B here.\nIf you want to use other data, you’ll need it to meet some specifications we’ll describe, and you’ll have to get Dr. Love’s permission when you register your project.\nSince most people consider working with NHANES data to be easier, we will award four extra points to projects which use non-NHANES data.\n\n\n\nStudy 1\n\nStudy 1 is about making descriptive and exploratory comparisons and summaries of data. It’s not about building sophisticated statistical models.\nYou will ingest, merge and clean the data in R, then select variables to complete any four out of five potential analyses, as described in these instructions.\n\nYou can do all five analyses if you like (as preparation for Quiz 2, for instance) but you will only present four in your report. No bonus credit for doing all five analyses.\n\nDr Love has developed Study 1 Report Specifications and a Study 1 Sample Report which should guide your eventual submitted Study 1 report.\n\n\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 is about building a model and making predictions. You will complete all elements of a data science project designed to create a statistical model for a quantitative outcome, then use it for prediction, and assess the quality of those predictions.\nStudy 2 involves working with data from the same source that you used for Study 1. Again, you will work through all cleaning and data management requirements in your Study 2 report.\n\nStudy 2 involves the prediction of a quantitative outcome using a key predictor and some additional predictors in two linear regression models, and then comparing those two models.\nAll of the material you need (from a statistical and coding perspective) to do these analyses has been or will be covered in our first 24 classes and in the Course Notes.\n\nDr Love has developed Study 2 Report Specifications and a Study 2 Sample Report which should guide your eventual submitted Study 2 report.\n\n\n\nGrading\nProject B will be graded by Dr. Love on a scale from 0-150 points.\n\nOn-time successful completion of the Registration Form is worth 15 points.\nThe two study reports (Study 1 and Study 2) due at the final Project B deadline are worth a combined 60 points.\nThe oral presentation is also worth 60 points. Details on the Oral Presentation are found in the Checklist.\nThe self-evaluation is worth 15 points.\nLate work on Project B is unacceptable. All deadlines are in the Course Calendar.\n\nDr. Love will provide no written feedback on your Project B work. The grading timeline is simply too tight on my end. I apologize in advance.\n\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have questions, let us know about them on Campuswire using the projectB folder, or speak with Dr. Love before or after class, or discuss them with the TAs during office hours."

With height measured in inches, do we really think there should be a height as small as 22.83 inches?\nThe weight minimum is also a problem. Is 1 pound a reasonable value?\nWe also want to create a body mass index from the height and weight data\n\n\n2.2.1 Combining height and weight into bmi and Specifying NA for Implausible Values\nWe will calculate bmi (body-mass index) from the available height (inches) and weight (pounds) data. The BMI formula for inches and pounds is available at http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmi-formula.php. A reasonable range for BMI values is probably about 15 to 50.\n\nsur15_m &lt;- sur15_m |&gt;\n    mutate(bmi = 703 * weight / height^2)\n\nsur15_m |&gt; reframe(lovedist(bmi))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n      n  miss  mean    sd   med   mad   min   q25   q75   max\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    53     0  26.2  23.5  23.2  3.25 0.159  21.2  25.5  189.\n\n\nThe minimum calculated bmi value seems impossibly low, and the highest bmi seems impossibly high.

We want to focus on actually plausible results.\n\nA reasonable guess is that no one in the class was less than about 122 centimeters, or 4 feet tall (48 inches) nor were they greater than about 213 centimeters, or 7 feet tall (84 inches) so we’re going to change any values outside that range to NA.\nSimilarly, it seems reasonable to assume that no one in the class was below 80 pounds (36.3 kg) or above 400 pounds (181.4 kg) so again, we’ll regard any values we see outside that range is implausible and change them to NA.\n\nI’ll do this by creating new variables height_r and weight_r where the _r (meaning “revised”) indicates to me that I’ve revised the original variable in some way without adding a lot of characters to its name.\n\nsur15_m &lt;- sur15_m |&gt;\n    mutate(height_r = replace(height, height &lt; 48 | height &gt; 84, NA),\n           weight_r = replace(weight, weight &lt; 80 | weight &gt; 400, NA)) |&gt;\n    mutate(bmi = 703 * weight_r / height_r ^2)\n\nsur15_m |&gt; select(height_r, weight_r, bmi) |&gt;\n  data_codebook()\n\nselect(sur15_m, height_r, weight_r, bmi) (53 rows and 3 variables, 3 shown)\n\nID | Name     | Type    | Missings |         Values |  N\n---+----------+---------+----------+----------------+---\n1  | height_r | numeric | 2 (3.8%) |       [61, 74] | 51\n---+----------+---------+----------+----------------+---\n2  | weight_r | numeric | 1 (1.9%) |     [107, 320] | 52\n---+----------+---------+----------+----------------+---\n3  | bmi      | numeric | 3 (5.7%) | [18.64, 41.08] | 50\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo now, we have 2 missing values of height_r, 1 missing value of weight_r and we have calculated BMI results, with 3 missing values, and our ranges (minimum and maximum) for each of these variables now look OK."

    "text": "4.1 The Question\nWe’ll compare the r_now scores to r_pre scores. The scores are paired by subject, as each subject gives us both a r_pre and r_now score, and computing and assessing within-subject differences in comfort with R makes sense, because we are interested in the change in each person’s comfort level. We’ll generally use r_now - r_pre in our calculations, so that positive numbers indicate improvements in confidence. Note that we’ll use a 90% confidence level throughout this demonstration project for all analyses, and I encourage you to do this in your actual Project B Study 1 work, as well.\nSo, our research question might be something like:\nWhat is a typical change in comfort with R experienced by students in 431 through the first couple of months in the course?"

    "text": "4.2 Describing the Data\n\n4.2.1 Compute and summarize the paired differences\nThe natural first step is to compute paired differences between the r_now and r_pre samples, and then use graphical and numerical summaries to assess whether the sample (of differences) can be assumed to follow a Normal distribution. First, we’ll calculate the paired differences.\n\nsur_15 &lt;- sur_15 |&gt;\n    mutate(r_diff = r_now - r_pre)\n\nsur_15 |&gt; reframe(lovedist(r_diff)) |&gt; gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nmiss\nmean\nsd\nmed\nmad\nmin\nq25\nq75\nmax\n\n\n\n\n49\n0\n35.08163\n29.06017\n25\n37.065\n0\n10\n60\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK. It appears that we have successfully subtracted the PRE data from the NOW data, and everyone has a difference of at least zero. Now, we’ll assess whether or not a Normal distribution might be a reasonable model for the data.\n\n\n4.2.2 Graphical Summaries to Assess Normality\nWe should start by looking at the distribution of these 49 values of r_diff. As we’ve seen, there’s a floor effect at zero.\nA histogram with 49 values won’t give us a lot of information. Perhaps we should focus instead on a Normal Q-Q plot and boxplot with violin? We’ll draw all three here.\n\nbw = 5 # specify width of bins in histogram\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(sur_15, aes(x = r_diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = bw, \n                 fill = \"slateblue\", col = \"springgreen\") +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x)\n    dnorm(x, mean = mean(sur_15$r_diff), sd = sd(sur_15$r_diff)) *\n      length(sur_15$r_diff) * bw,  \n    geom = \"area\", alpha = 0.5, fill = \"lightblue\", col = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"R Comfort Rating Difference\", \n       title = \"Histogram & Normal Curve\") \n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(sur_15, aes(sample = r_diff)) +\n  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(col = \"slateblue\") +\n  labs(y = \"Rating Difference\",\n       x = \"Standard Normal Distribution\",\n       title = \"Normal Q-Q plot\") \n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(sur_15, aes(x = r_diff, y = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"mintcream\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 16, col = \"slateblue\") +\n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"Current - Pre-class Rating Difference\", \n       title = \"Boxplot with Violin\")\n\np1 + (p2 / p3 + plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1))) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Most Students Improved R Comfort Ratings during 431\",\n    caption = glue(\"Sample Size = \", nrow(sur_15)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith just 49 observations, it will be a little difficult to get a clear picture of whether a Normal approximation is reasonable or not. I would conclude that a bootstrap approach would be a better choice here than a Normal model for the paired differences, owing to the floor effect (many zeros) in the paired differences.\n\nsur_15 |&gt; reframe(lovedist(r_diff)) |&gt; gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nmiss\nmean\nsd\nmed\nmad\nmin\nq25\nq75\nmax\n\n\n\n\n49\n0\n35.08163\n29.06017\n25\n37.065\n0\n10\n60\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data seem a bit right skewed, as well. The sample mean is 34.7% of a standard deviation larger than the sample median2.\n\n\n4.2.3 Did Pairing Help Reduce Nuisance Variation?\nWe would expect a strong correlation between the r_pre and r_now scores in this repeated measures analysis where each subject is assessing both their confidence before the class and then again during the class. To assess whether pairing helped reduce nuisance variation, I’ll build a scatterplot of the r_pre and r_now scores, supplemented by a Pearson correlation coefficient. Since we have so many ties in the data, with two or more points in the same place, I’ll use geom_jitter rather than geom_point to plot the points. The larger the correlation, the more that pairing will help reduce the impact of differences between subjects on the r_pre score on the comparison we’re trying to make.\n\nggplot(sur_15, aes(x = r_pre, y = r_now)) +\n    geom_jitter(col = \"slateblue\") +\n    geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", col = \"red\") +\n    labs(title = \"Jittered Scatterplot shows moderately strong relationship\",\n         subtitle = \"especially for those starting above 0\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor people with a r_pre score greater than zero, we see a pretty strong linear relationship between r_pre and r_now.\n\nsur_15 |&gt; select(r_pre, r_now) |&gt; correlation()\n\n# Correlation Matrix (pearson-method)\n\nParameter1 | Parameter2 |    r |       95% CI | t(47) |         p\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nr_pre      |      r_now | 0.50 | [0.26, 0.69] |  3.99 | &lt; .001***\n\np-value adjustment method: Holm (1979)\nObservations: 49\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation is quite strong at 0.5 so that a linear model using the r_pre score accounts for a reasonably large fraction (25.3%) of the variation in r_now scores.\n\nIf the Pearson correlation had been small but still positive (perhaps less than 0.2), we might conclude that pairing wouldn’t be exceptionally helpful, but if the samples are meant to be paired, we should still do a paired samples analysis, but such a small correlation would imply that an independent samples comparison would come to about the same conclusion."

This conclusion is motivated by a bootstrap estimate to compare paired responses from students before and after the first couple of months of the course, and I feel this is the most justified approach based on my assessment of Normality in the data from these 49 students.\nA natural next step would be to look at values of something like this over multiple years, or perhaps comparing students at more than just two stages. It would also be appealing to measure comfort with R at the earlier time, and then return to the students later, rather than asking them to remember where they were at the start a couple of months later. There are several other possible next steps here, too, depending on what population you might decide to target."

Plus, as we’ll see, there are different numbers of English and non-English preferring subjects, so there’s no way their bmi values could be paired. As a result, we’re going to be interested in looking at the two samples separately to help us understand issues related to hypothesis testing assumptions.

Regardless, here is a 90% confidence interval for the difference between the “No” group and the “Yes” group population mean bmi based on Welch’s test.\n\nt.test(bmi ~ english, data = sur_15, conf.level = 0.90) \n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  bmi by english\nt = -0.4609, df = 42.944, p-value = 0.6472\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group No and group Yes is not equal to 0\n90 percent confidence interval:\n -2.339923  1.332950\nsample estimates:\n mean in group No mean in group Yes \n         23.52387          24.02736 \n\n\n\nThe point estimates for the two population bmi means are 23.523 for No and 24.027 for Yes, so the average student who speaks English best has a BMI estimated to be about 0.504 points higher points higher than the average for a student who speaks another language better than English, based on our samples.\nOur 90% confidence interval for the difference (English - non-English) of the population means is (-1.33, 2.34).\n\nThe confidence interval reflects imprecision in the population estimate, based only on assuming that the participants are selected at random from the population of interest.\nWhen we generalize beyond study participants to the population they were selected at random from, then our data are compatible (at the 90% confidence level) with differences between the two population means between -1.33 and 2.34, depending on the assumptions of our Welch t test being correct.\n\nThe assumptions of the Welch’s t test are\n\nthat the samples in each group are drawn independently of each other,\nthat the samples in each group represent a random sample of the population of interest,\nand that the samples in each group are drawn from a Normally distributed population.\n\nThe last of these assumptions is especially hard to justify given these data.\nHere, I’ve also used a two-sided confidence interval procedure, which is what we’ll do in all work for 431, not just Project B.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 The Pooled t test (t test with equal variances)\nThe pooled t test, of course, actually adds an assumption (that either the sample sizes or the population variances are equal) to the assumptions of the Welch test. As mentioned above, the large difference in the sample variances and sample sizes makes this test unattractive, in addition to the problems with assuming Normality. Regardless, here is a 90% confidence interval for the difference between the non-English and English population mean bmi based on the pooled t test.\n\nfitB &lt;- lm(bmi ~ english, data = sur_15) \n\nmodel_parameters(fitB, ci = 0.90)\n\nParameter     | Coefficient |   SE |         90% CI | t(47) |      p\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)   |       23.52 | 1.04 | [21.78, 25.27] | 22.67 | &lt; .001\nenglish [Yes] |        0.50 | 1.26 | [-1.62,  2.63] |  0.40 | 0.692 \n\n\n\nUncertainty intervals (equal-tailed) and p-values (two-tailed) computed\n  using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n\n\n\nThe point BMI estimates are 23.523 for No and 24.027 for Yes, so the average student who speaks English best has a BMI estimated to be about 0.504 points higher than the average for a student who speaks another language better than English, based on our samples.\nOur 90% confidence interval for the difference (English - non-English) of the population means is now (-1.62, 2.63) based on the pooled t procedure.\n\nThe confidence interval reflects imprecision in the population estimate, based only on assuming that the participants are selected at random from the population of interest.\nWhen we generalize beyond study participants to the population they were selected at random from, then our data are compatible (at the 90% confidence level) with differences between the two population means between -1.62 and 2.63, depending on the assumptions of our linear model being correct.\n\nThe assumptions of the pooled t test are\n\nthat the samples in each group are drawn independently of each other,\nthat the samples in each group represent a random sample of the population of interest,\nthe samples in each group are drawn from a Normally distributed population,\nand that either the sample sizes or the population variances are equal.\n\nThe Normality assumption remains hard to justify given these data, so we should look at alternatives.\nHere, I’ve again used a two-sided confidence interval procedure, as we’ll do in all 431 work.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 The Bootstrap for comparing means from two independent samples\nAn independent samples comparison that doesn’t require Normality is the bootstrap. Here is a 90% confidence interval for the difference between the English and non-English population bmi distributions based on the bootstrap using a seed of 431. (Note: when you set a seed for this or other analyses in the project, pick something other than 431.)\n\nset.seed(431)\nsur_15 |&gt;\n  specify(bmi ~ english) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\",\n    order = c(\"Yes\", \"No\") ) |&gt;\n  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.90, type = \"percentile\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower_ci upper_ci\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    -1.19     2.28\n\n\n\nThe population mean BMI in those who said Yes is estimated to be about 0.504 points higher than the population mean BMI for those who said No, based on our samples. So the mean differences’ point estimate is 0.504\nOur 90% bootstrapped confidence interval for the difference (Yes - No) of the population means is (-1.19, 2.28).\n\nWhen we generalize beyond study participants to the population they were selected at random from, then our data are compatible (at the 90% confidence level) with differences between the two population means between -1.19 and 2.28, depending on the assumptions of our bootstrap estimation procedure being correct.\n\nThe assumptions of this bootstrap procedure are:\n\nthat the samples in each group are drawn independently of each other,\nand that the samples in each group represent a random sample of the population of interest.\n\nAgain, I’ve used a two-sided confidence interval procedure.\n\nSo, I think the bootstrap procedure would be most appropriate here, due to the non-Normality (and in particular the asymmetry) in the samples."

This conclusion is motivated by a bootstrap estimate to compare the two groups (English and non-English) across 49 subjects. I feel this is the most justified approach based on the apparent skew in the data (particularly among those who speak English best) in these students.\nIf this were an actual Project B Study 1, I’d discuss the other issues that go into a conclusion, including limitations of this study and suggestions about logical next steps.

We’re comparing the mean comfort_431 scores of the population represented by the respondents who got their best grades_r on individual work, to the population represented by the respondents who got their best grades_r with a partner, to the population represented by the respondents who got their best grades_r on group work. There is no link between subjects across the three grades_r groups, so the samples are independent. Plus, as we’ll see, there are different numbers of subjects in the three grades_r groups, so there’s no way their comfort_431 values could be matched. As a result, we’re going to be interested in looking at the three samples separately to help us understand issues related to hypothesis testing assumptions. Note that we’ll use a 90% confidence level throughout this demonstration project for all analyses, and I encourage you to do this in your actual Project B Study 1 work, as well.\nIf this were an actual Study 1, rather than a demonstration, I’d build a research question here, but that will be your job."

All of the values in each group are within the stated response levels (0-100) but otherwise, there’s not a lot to go on. ANOVA is quite robust, so we’ll run it, but I expect that a Kruskal-Wallis approach may also be useful here.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Numerical Summaries\nWith so few observations in the Partner and Group grades_r levels, there’s not much to see in numerical summaries, either.\n\nsur_15 |&gt; group_by(grades_r) |&gt; reframe(lovedist(comfort_431))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 11\n  grades_r       n  miss  mean    sd   med   mad   min   q25   q75   max\n  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Individual    40     0  79.0  15.3    80  14.8    35  73.8  90     100\n2 Partner        4     0  63.8  23.6    70  11.1    30  60    73.8    85\n3 Group          5     0  78.4  17.8    85  14.8    50  73    89      95\n\n\nWe have 40 Individual, 4 Partner and 5 Group subjects with known comfort levels.\nThe conclusion I draw from all of this is that we need to run but that we probably can’t trust an ANOVA here, with such small sample sizes in the non-Individual grades_r levels. Anything below 10 subjects is just too small, and, practically, I’d consider collapsing the groups to Individual vs. All Other. But for this demonstration, I’ll press on."

We really need a minimum of 15 observations (and ideally more like 30) in each group to let our histograms and boxplots have any chance to be informative on these points. We’ll move on to looking at the pairwise comparisons, though, in this demonstration.\n\n6.3.1 Holm approach to Pairwise Comparisons of Means\nWe have two approaches available for dealing with multiple comparisons. If we had not pre-planned the full set of pairwise comparisons of comfort_431 across the grades_r categories, or if we wanted to use a fairly conservative approach, we could apply a Holm correction to our comparisons. This works reasonably well even with an unbalanced design, such as we have here, and I recommend you use this approach in Project B Study 1 Analysis C4.\n\nconC1 &lt;- estimate_contrasts(fitC, contrast = \"grades_r\", \n                           ci = 0.90, p.adjust = \"holm\")\n\nconC1 |&gt; gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel1\nLevel2\nDifference\nCI_low\nCI_high\nSE\ndf\nt\np\n\n\n\n\nIndividual\nGroup\n0.55\n-16.295760\n17.395760\n7.678480\n46\n0.07162876\n0.9432079\n\n\nIndividual\nPartner\n15.20\n-3.423689\n33.823689\n8.488879\n46\n1.79057809\n0.2398296\n\n\nPartner\nGroup\n-14.65\n-38.473503\n9.173503\n10.859010\n46\n-1.34911010\n0.3678106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur process detects positive differences between the mean of the Partner category and the means of the other two categories, but suggests that the difference between Individual and Group means covers both positive and negative values.\n\nNote that a more comprehensive discussion of the confidence intervals here might be helpful, but I’ll leave that to you.\n\nThe assumptions here include the ANOVA assumptions, which are no more or less justified than they were before.

(In your project, you’ll explain what your relative risk point estimate means in detail, but don’t worry about interpreting the CI - just specify the lower and upper bounds.)\nThe odds ratio describing the odds of Prior R use given English vs. Non-English, which is estimated to be 1.29 with 90% CI (0.52, 3.22). (In your project B, you’ll explain what your odds ratio point estimate means in detail, but don’t worry about interpreting the CI - just specify the lower and upper bounds.)\nThe difference in probability of Prior R use for English vs. non-English subjects, which is estimated to be 0.0635, with a 90% confidence interval of (-0.1576, 0.2740). (In your project, you’ll explain what your point estimate for the probability difference means in detail and also state and interpret the CI for the probability difference.)\nThe chi-square test of independence, which assesses the null hypothesis of no association between language preference and prior R usage, using either Fisher’s exact test or the Pearson chi-square test (labeled asymptotic here.) The p value here is quite large.\n\n\n7.3.1 Checking Assumptions\nSince each cell in our (non-augmented) 2x2 table is at least 5, R throws no warning messages. We should be reasonably comfortable with the chi-square test of independence here. If every cell was 10 or more, we’d be even more comfortable.\n\n\n7.3.2 What If We Wanted to Type in the Table Ourselves?\nWith the twobytwo function available in the Love-boost.R script, we can directly obtain 90% confidence intervals. For example, suppose we had the following data, pulled from our 2016 survey:\n\n\n\n2016 Survey\nDrank Tea Recently\nDidn’t Drink Tea\n\n\n\n\nNot Born in US\n21\n10\n\n\nUS Born\n20\n18\n\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to use twobytwo and the +2/+4 Bayesian augmentation (adding 2 to the count in each cell of our 2x2 table) and a 90% confidence interval for this comparison, to see whether the population proportions who drank tea recently differ between those born in and out of the US.\n\ntwobytwo(21+2, 10+2, 20+2, 18+2,\n         \"Not US Born\", \"US Born\", \"Drank Tea\", \"No Tea\",\n         conf.level = 0.90)\n\n2 by 2 table analysis: \n------------------------------------------------------ \nOutcome   : Drank Tea \nComparing : Not US Born vs. US Born \n\n            Drank Tea No Tea    P(Drank Tea) 90% conf. interval\nNot US Born        23     12          0.6571    0.5162   0.7749\nUS Born            22     20          0.5238    0.3982   0.6465\n\n                                   90% conf. interval\n             Relative Risk: 1.2545    0.9160   1.7181\n         Sample Odds Ratio: 1.7424    0.8024   3.7839\nConditional MLE Odds Ratio: 1.7299    0.7276   4.1948\n    Probability difference: 0.1333   -0.0512   0.3036\n\n             Exact P-value: 0.2561 \n        Asymptotic P-value: 0.2389 \n------------------------------------------------------"

The medium_r data have three levels, and the fiction_r data have four levels. Note that we’ll use a 90% confidence level and I encourage you to do this in your actual Project B Study 1 work, as well.\nIf this were an actual Study 1, rather than a demonstration, I’d build a research question here, but I have decided to leave that work to you."

    "text": "8.3 Main Analysis\n\n8.3.1 Running the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) Test\nWe’ll run the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) test using:\n\nchisq.test(table_E1)\n\nWarning in stats::chisq.test(x, y, ...): Chi-squared approximation may be\nincorrect\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table_E1\nX-squared = 8.2621, df = 6, p-value = 0.2195\n\n\nNote the warning, because our table does not meet the Cochran conditions.\n\n\n8.3.2 Running Fisher’s Exact Test\nNOTE: In doing your project B, I would only proceed once I’d identified variables (after whatever collapsing you decide to do) that meet the Cochran conditions (described below.) I would not run Fisher’s test.\nGiven a small overall sample size, the fisher.test command will also produce a Fisher’s exact test, which may be a little more appropriate here, given the presence of cells with small counts.\n\nfisher.test(table_E1)\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  table_E1\np-value = 0.2096\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nBased on the Fisher test, we would get only a slightly different conclusion than the Pearson test. However,\n\nOur conclusions are quite dependent on the choice of \\(\\alpha\\) level.\nNeither test is really appropriate, since we have very small cell counts, including a zero.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Checking Assumptions - The Cochran Conditions\nThe “Cochran conditions”, which require that we have:\n\nno cells with 0 counts\nat least 80% of the cells in our table with counts of 5 or higher\nexpected counts in each cell of the table should be 5 or more\n\nWe don’t meet those Cochran conditions here. In addition, since each cell in our 3x4 table is NOT at least 5, R throws a warning message when we run the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) test, and since we don’t meet the Cochran conditions, the fisher.test results are questionable, as well. We should consider whether collapsing or deleting some of the rows or columns might be more reasonable. And we’ll do this next.\n\n\n8.3.4 An Association Plot for the 3x4 Table\nThe assocplot function in R produces a plot that indicates deviations from the assumption of independence of rows and columns in a two-way table. For instance, using our original table, we have:\n\nassocplot(table_E1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the independence model really doesn’t work well for the cells with larger shapes here, which we note especially in the Fantasy/SF category, and to some extent in the Comedy category.\nHint: Finding a better scheme for visualizing a contingency table’s relationship to independence (or simply the table itself), especially if it’s using the gt package, would be a good idea to explore further in Analysis E, too, especially if you’re looking to learn to build savvy tables. But this is not necessary, certainly.\n\n\n8.3.5 A 2x3 Table, After Collapsing (Lumping) Some Small Rows and Columns\nSuppose we instead decided to drop down to a study of TV vs. Other media (combining Movies and Other) and also collapsed the Fantasy/SF and Other columns (so the remaining subjects form a 2x3 table), in an effort to remove zero cells, and reduce the incidence of cells with counts below 5.\nFirst, we’ll combine the Movies and Other groups to create medium_2 from medium_r using fct_recode.\n\nsur_15 &lt;- sur_15 |&gt;\n  mutate(medium_2 = fct_recode(medium_r, \n                                \"Not TV\" = \"Movies\",\n                                \"TV\" = \"TV\",\n                                \"Not TV\" = \"Other\"))\n\nOr, we can use the fct_lump function to lump together the two categories with the smallest overall counts directly, in creating fiction_3 from fiction_r.\n\nsur_15 &lt;- sur_15 |&gt;\n  mutate(fiction_3 = fct_lump(fiction_r, 2))\n\nLet’s call the collapsed table table_E2.\n\ntable_E2 &lt;- \n  table(sur_15$medium_2, sur_15$fiction_3)\n\ntable_E2\n\n        \n         Comedy Drama Other\n  Not TV      7     9    12\n  TV         10     5     6\n\n\nThis new 2x3 table loses some fidelity, but gains in that each cell now contains at least 5 subjects. I’ll remind you that in your Project B, we’re requiring you to have even more than that in each cell.\n\n\n8.3.6 Chi-Square Testing for the 2x3 Table\nAnd here are the results from chi-square testing…\n\nchisq.test(table_E2)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table_E2\nX-squared = 2.7279, df = 2, p-value = 0.2556\n\nfisher.test(table_E2)\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  table_E2\np-value = 0.2765\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nFor the project, once all of the cells have at least 5 observations, I recommend the use of the Pearson approach, unless the table is square (# of rows = # of columns), in which case the Fisher test is also a reasonable choice. Generally, the Fisher test is more appropriate when the sample sizes are small. In this case, of course, it doesn’t matter much after collapsing cells and forming this 2x3 table. We’ll close with the association plot for this smaller table, which suggests that the independence model inverts its errors for Comedy as compared to the other two categories.\n\nassocplot(table_E2)"

    "text": "Headings you should use in the Study 1 report\nAll of your work should be done in a fresh R project in a clean directory on your computer. - If you are working with NHANES data, your directory should include a data subdirectory, in which you will probably need to place the Love-431.R script. - If you need to ingest non-NHANES data, then your data directory should also include the raw data files.\n\nSetup and Data Ingest\n\nBe sure to load all necessary packages and ingest your data, either by reading it in with nhanesA or by reading in your raw non-NHANES data. Load the tidyverse last and do not load core packages from the tidyverse separately.\n\nCleaning the Data\n\nBe sure to review the material (including the Tips on Cleaning Data) provided in the Data Development section of this website.\nNote that it’s only necessary to clean the variables you will actually use in your four analyses below. Select only those variables (including the subject identifier) here when you create your analytic tibble.\nI also suggest applying janitor::clean_names at the start, but I wouldn’t otherwise change variable names if you’re not changing the meaning of the variables. If you want to change the names, you can, but then you must indicate that in your codebook, and do the renaming before you show the codebook.\nIf you create a new categorical variable from an existing quantitative variables, do so in this section of your report, and then refer to that work in the analyses below when you use the new variable.\n\nCodebook and Data Description\n\nThe first thing that should appear in the section is a description of the subjects of your study.\n\nAs an example of what I’m looking for, suppose that you are working with NHANES data and have identified 3500 adults between the ages of 21 and 79 who have complete data on the variables in your final data set. In that case, the description I would want to see would be: “3500 adults ages 21-79 participating in NHANES 2017-2020 with complete data on the variables listed in the table below.”\n\nIn the first subsection in this section, labeled Codebook, present a codebook where you list all of the variables you will actually use in your four chosen analyses, in the format you will use in those analyses. Do not include any other variables (besides the subject identifying code) in the codebook.\nPresent your codebook in a table, with either three or four columns.\nPlace the variable name you will use in your analyses in the left-most column. The Codebook lists all of the variables you will use in your analyses (plus the subject identifying code). If you’re working with NHANES data, you should include both SEQN (subject code) in this list.\nThe type of variable should be Quant (for quantitative variables), Binary (for two-category variables), or X-cat for multi-category variables) where X should either be 3, 4, 5 or 6, to indicate the number of levels in the variable.\nIf you’ve changed a variable name (other than the obvious changes made by clean_names) from what you imported initially from your data source, add a final column where you specify the original variable name. The original name alone is sufficient here.\n\nFor those working with NHANES data, we will already be able to tell which data set in NHANES you used to obtain this variable from your initial pull of the data with the nhanesA package, so don’t specify the data set name again here.\n\n\n\nMake sure your Codebook looks nice and is easy to read in your HTML result. - If you decide to rename any of the variables from the names provided with the raw data, you should specify your new name and the original name in your codebook. - Your codebook should also describe each of the variables you are using and specify whether they are quantitative, binary or multi-categorical. - In the second subsection (called Analytic Tibble), list your clean tibble that the codebook describes, so we can see it is a tibble. Only the variables in your Codebook should appear. - In the third and final subsection here, labeled Data Summary, provide useful descriptive summaries of each variable in your codebook other than the subject identifying code. You can use describe from Hmisc or another option of your choosing to accomplish this. You needn’t provide graphical summaries here, and include only variables that are in your codebook.\nThose first three sections should then be followed by any four of the following five sections (which will be sections 4-7 in your report)…\n\nAnalysis A: Comparing 2 Means with Paired Samples\nAnalysis B: Comparing 2 Means with Independent Samples\nAnalysis C: Comparing X Means with Independent Samples (where you’d substitute in the number of means you’re comparing for X)\nAnalysis D: Analyzing a 2x2 table\nAnalysis E: Analyzing a JxK table (where you substitute in the values for J and K)\n\n\nWithin each of the four analyses you present, I’d have four (numbered) subsections:\n\nThe Question\n\nStart by describing what you want to study, and then specify a research question (which should end with a question mark and be something you can resolve with the planned analysis.)\nDon’t boil the ocean here. You’re looking for a research question that can be reasonably addressed using your data, so it has to be pretty straightforward.\nIf you have a pre-existing belief about what will happen, before you look at the data, please feel encouraged to include a statement about that belief before specifying your question.\n\nDescribing The Data\n\nThis should start with specifications of what each of the variables you are studying in this analysis actually mean.\nYour cleaning, creation of factors and other data management activities for each analysis should already have been shown in earlier sections. Please refer back to that section and don’t repeat what you’ve already done. Be sure that the Codebook you provided describes all variables you are using in your analyses here.\nProvide numerical summaries and visualizations of interest that are relevant to the analysis, and comment on any issues you observe.\n\nMain Analysis\n\nShow your work, and comment on whatever decisions you make.\nBe sure to present and justify the assumptions you are making.\n\nConclusions\n\nAnswer your research question, by clearly linking the analytic results to what you were asking at the start.\nIf you can see a logical next step for the analysis of the question you asked, specify it. Also, if you specified a pre-existing belief about what would happen, reflect on that in light of the data."

Use those selections to create your analytic data set.\n\nYou must have between (500 and 7,500 observations if you’re using NHANES; 250 and 10,000 observations if not using NHANES) with complete data on all 6-11 variables included in your Study 2 analytic tibble. No other variables should be included in your Study 2 analytic tibble.\n\nClean the data in R, and this includes the creation of appropriately labeled (and if necessary, collapsed) factors for all categorical variables, and the investigation and decision-making regarding missing values, numbers of unique values and impossible values.\nComplete any imputation required to deal with missing data. Use single (simple) imputation with the mice package to create your imputed data. Do not impute your outcome or key predictor - you should filter to complete cases on those two variables.\nUse appropriate tools to provide useful numerical summaries for all data you will study, after all cleaning, so that these results describe the exact variables you will be modeling in the remaining work. Provide a clear note describing how much imputation you did.\nPartition the clean data into a model development (also called a model training) sample (60-80% of the data) and a model testing (also called a model validation) sample (the remaining 20-40%) using the approach recommended in the data .\n\nSuppose you had a tibble called original_data which identified its subjects with a subjID variable, and you wanted to place 75% of your data for development into training_sample and the rest into test_sample. You could do that with the following code…\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(431) # pick a different seed than this\n\ntraining_sample &lt;- original_data |&gt; slice_sample(prop = 0.75)\n\ntest_sample &lt;- \n    anti_join(original_data, training_sample, by = \"subjID\")\n\n\nProvide appropriate, well-labeled visualizations of your outcome, and investigate potential transformations of that outcome for the purpose of fitting regression models in a useful way. Whatever transformation (including no transformation at all) should be used for the steps that follow.\nProduce two competitive models fit using least squares (rather than a Bayesian approach) for predicting your outcome using your clean data that provide evidence regarding your research question.\n\nOne of these models should be the full model with all candidate predictors included.\nYour other model should be a well-motivated subset of your full model, that at least includes the key predictor and one more predictor.\n\nAssess the performance of your two models (full model or subset) and come to a conclusion about which is better. This assessment should includes both in-sample (predictive performance and adherence to assumptions) and holdout sample (predictive quality) assessments. Be sure to attend to back-transformation properly should that be necessary, in evaluating the quality of predictions.\nUse the results of the model you chose to answer your research question, and then describe the limitations of this study and next steps you would like to pursue.\nJust to reiterate, in Study 2, you should explicitly state that you are assuming that “missing at random (MAR)” is the most appropriate missing data mechanism and then use single imputation for Study 2, with two exceptions: (1) I don’t want you to impute your outcome or key predictor, so you will need to filter to complete cases on those variables, and (2) you may decide to add on a multiple imputation summary of parameters for the final model if you choose, as we’ll discuss in Class 21."

You really should.\nOutside of those caveats, the Sample Study 2 Report is meant to be accurate and reflect the level of detail I’m looking for, although it is certainly possible to expand on these demonstrations in your work, if that seems helpful. I believe the Sample Study 2 Report documents to be largely accurate, but many eyes will find some issues, eventually. If people find corrections and would be good enough to post them to Campuswire (under the projectB folder, please) I will attempt to reflect those edits in revisions. If I do something in the Sample Study 2 Report that appears to be in conflict with the instructions for Study 2, then (a) please let me know, and (b) treat the Study 2 instructions as your guidepost in completing your work."
